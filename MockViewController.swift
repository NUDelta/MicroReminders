         This should never be relevant - we should only ever enter after exiting. What that means
         is that we should check this value before it is set here, and set it again in "didExitRegion"
         before we check it next. However, since the beacons are buggy, and I'm concerned about
         sequential "didEnterRegion" events, I'm leaving this in here.
